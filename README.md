# MINI_PROJECT-OF-MINI-ATM-MACHINE-OOPS
ATM Management System using Python OOPS with PIN verification and withdrawal limit. A menu-driven console application demonstrating abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

# ATM Management System – Python (OOPS)

This mini project is a console-based ATM Management System developed using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.

The project simulates basic ATM operations such as checking balance, depositing money, withdrawing money with a maximum limit, viewing account details, and exiting safely after PIN verification.

## Features
- Menu-driven ATM system
- PIN-based access
- Balance enquiry
- Deposit and withdrawal
- Maximum withdrawal limit
- Account details display

## OOPS Concepts Used
- Abstraction (Abstract Base Class)
- Encapsulation (Private and protected variables)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (Method overriding)
- Class, Static, and Instance methods

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells
3. Enter the PIN to access ATM services
4. Choose options from the menu

## Sample Login
- PIN: 2006
